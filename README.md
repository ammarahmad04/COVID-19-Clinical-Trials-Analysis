# COVID-19-Clinical-Trials-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning on COVID-19 clinical trials to uncover insights on trial phases, statuses, demographics, and global contributions.

**üß™ COVID-19 Clinical Trials Analysis**

Domain: Data Analytics / Machine Learning
Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn), Tableau (for dashboards)
Difficulty Level: Intermediate

**üìù About Dataset**
The dataset provides detailed information about COVID-19 clinical trials conducted worldwide. It includes attributes such as:

Trial phases (Phase I, II, III, IV).

Trial status (ongoing, completed, terminated, etc.).

Locations and countries.

Enrollment size (number of participants).

Demographic data (age, gender groups studied).

Timeline of trial start and completion dates.

This dataset helps in understanding global research efforts and trends during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**üéØ Project Overview**
The objective of this project is to analyze and model COVID-19 clinical trials data to uncover insights and make predictions.

**üîë Key Objectives**

1.Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns

2.Analyze trial phases, statuses, and country-level contributions

3.Study enrollment distribution and demographics

4.Build machine learning models to predict trial outcomes or classifications

5.Create visual dashboards for interactive analysis

**‚öôÔ∏è Steps to Follow**

1.Define Scope & Objectives

   -Analyze clinical trials globally

  -Identify patterns in trial phases, locations, and success rates

2.Data Preparation

   -Clean and preprocess raw dataset using Pandas

   -Handle missing values and inconsistent data

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  -Visualize trial phases and statuses

  -Study country-wise trial distributions

  -Analyze enrollment size and demographics

4.Feature Engineering

  -Create new features (e.g., duration of trials, success ratio)

  -Encode categorical variables
  
5.Univariate Analysis

6.Bivariate Analysis

7.Time Series Analysis
